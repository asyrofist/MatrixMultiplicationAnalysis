# MatrixMultiplicationAnalysis

This repository contains the implementation of matrix multiplication algorithms:
* Brute Force - ijk method
* Divide and Conquer - Recursive Algorithm
* Strassen's Algorithm

Also you will find the experimental results obtained, which are expected according to the theory.
